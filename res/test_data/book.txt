In the preface to the first edition of Rienzi Bulwer says: "I began this
tale two years ago at Rome. On removing to Naples, I threw it aside for The
Last Days of Pompeii, which required more than Rienzi the advantage of resi-
dence within reach of the scenes described. The fate of the Roman Tribune
continued, however, to haunt and impress me, and, some time after Pompeii
was published, I renewed my earlier undertaking. I regarded the completion
of these volumes, indeed, as a kind of duty; for having had occasion to read
the original authorities from which modem historians have drawn their
accounts of the life of Rienzi, I was led to believe that a very remarkable man
had been superficially judged, and a very important period crudely examined."

N the earlier half of the fourteenth century,
near Rome, an innocent youth was taken for
one of the Orsini, a noble family then at deadly
feud with the house of Colonna, and was killed
by one of the horsemen of the latter. The
boy proved to be the younger brother of Cola
di Rienzi, who demanded justice of Stephen
Colonna. The chief compassionately promised
to make amends, but justice could not be rendered
for what had been a grievous error. This tragic event made a
new being of the youth Cola, who from that moment focused
all his faculties upon achieving revenge.

Years passed, and in 1347 Italy was in a serious condition.
In Rome the popes struggled in vain against the nobles, who,
deprived of papal check, had except for the awful feuds among
themselves unlimited power. The strongest barons were the
Orsini and the Colonna. They all oppressed the people, who
were further impoverished by bands of robbers who, secretly
protected by the barons, infested the public ways. More formidable robbers were the freebooters. The fiercest of these
                                                        was Waher de Montreal, who harbored the wild ambition that
                                                        Rome might become again the prize of the boldest warrior.

                                                        Time had deepened the solemn qualities in the character
                                                        of Cola di Rienzi. For the past six years he had grown steadily
                                                        in popular favor, and had now begun to appeal openly to the
                                                        people. He had no desire to be a demagogue; his one end
                                                        was the restoration of Rome, which could be brought about
                                                        only by the universal movement of the people. He asked for
                                                        equal laws and peace alike for the noblemen and the plebeians.
                                                        One of his first steps was to set up a picture before the market-
                                                        place, symbolizing the disasters that threatened Rome. This
                                                        picture stirred the people to great excitement.

                                                        About this time, Walter de Montreal was attracted one
                                                        night by a light in an uninhabited part of the Aventine. Look-
                                                        ing through a rent in the wall, he saw a hundred cloaked
                                                        men gathered around one who was concluding an address:

                                                        "Yes," said this man, "in the Church of the Lateran I will
                                                        make the last appeal to the people. Supported by the Vicar
                                                        of the Pope, it will be seen that Religion and Liberty — the
                                                        heroes and the martyrs — are united in one cause. By this
                                                        crucifix I pledge my faith to the regeneration of Rome! And
                                                        you, when the solitary trump is heard, you swear to rally round
                                                        the standard of the Republic, and resist the arms of the oppres-
                                                        sor."

                                                        "Death to the tyranny! Life to the Republic 1'* was the
                                                        muffled shout as Montreal slipped away.

                                                        A few days later a singular scene was enacted at the Church
                                                        of St. John of Lateran. Gathered there were the officers of the
                                                        Church, the Bishop of Orvieto, the marked personages of
                                                        Rome, and a throng of the people. In the rear of the church
                                                        a purple curtain w^as drawn, from behind which at the auspicious
                                                        moment Rienzi appeared, gorgeously robed. Ascending a
                                                        scaffold he addressed the assembly in eloquent words that
                                                        thrilled all hearts. He implored them to awaken, to banish
                                                        all the violence, fraud, and disorder — "Let the Pilgrims of the
                                                        world behold the resurrection of Rome!" In his courage lay
                                                        Rienzi's safety. The dissensions of the nobles among one
                                                        another were most favorable to him: he had attacked a body the members of which had no union. The people were already
                                                                                                                   gaping, with sparkling eyes. The speeches that followed did
                                                                                                                   not serve to placate them. The popular discontent had arrived
                                                                                                                   at a point where the people longed less for reform than for
                                                                                                                   change.

                                                                                                                   As Rienzi left the church he met Montreal, who told him
                                                                                                                   that he had witnessed at the Aventine the administration of
                                                                                                                   the oath of brotherhood to the conspirators; but, to prove his

                                                                                                                   Whatever distaste Rienzi felt for Montreal, he masked it skil-
                                                                                                                   fully, and invited him to his home. The sagacity of the latter
                                                                                                                   had perceived that the nobles did not possess the requisite
                                                                                                                   power to further his ends, so he turned to Rienzi, little caring
                                                                                                                   which party was uppermost so that his own objects were

                                                                                                                   But Rienzi matched his craftiness, and enticed him to reveal
                                                                                                                   all his secret projects. Then, with a clever stroke, feigning
