They mostly died gibbering, eyes wide, searching for something no one could see. I was in the storeroom, taking inventory of the powered milk, when Sal spasmed and sent a row of cans clattering to the floor, and I yelped and turned around to him and his eyes were just wild and flickering, rolling up into the back of his head, nearly twisting out of their sockets. He was trying to tell me something, I'm sure of it. And then the whole place was chaos, him and Maury and D'Angelo and all of them just having seizures, and I ran out to the floor and my god it was a madhouse in there. All the customers, flailing, pulling shelves down on themselves, that awful gibbering babble just looping in on itself and echoing and there was nothing I could do to make them stop, until they were all of them, all of them, dead.

Well. Not all of them. This nice lady named Virginia shrieking with the rest of them, but she was just panicking like I was. And Stevie and his kids. And Merle and Yvette and - and long story short we ventured out of the supermarket together, and then out into the city, and then listening for any news on the radio, and every time seeing the same thing repeated larger and larger and larger. They were all dead, died in their cars, died in their beds, died flying airplanes, died keeping the electricity running, all across the city and the country and the whole goddamn world, all of us huddled together around the radio listening for the news coming in. All of them dead. All of them except for us.

"Decimation," says Merle, as we're doing rounds. It's funny, in an apocalypse. You expect looting. You expect tyrants. You expect that the worst thing of all is your fellow man. But there ain't no zombies after us, no lack of food or gas or water. There's a fucking surplus to pick through here. Because we've done head counts, we've dragged away the bodies in rows of straight lines, we've extrapolated and done the math, and the numbers we come up with square with the numbers we hear on the radio. "A removal of a tenth," Merle says, with a weak smile. "Hence, decimal, decade. One-tenth of a military unit singled out and killed." Just rows and rows of bodies, and we've counted the ones who're left. "Just think, they used to consider that a severe punishment."

Ninety percent of the world is dead, more or less, more or less. We're just the ones who are left, all fucking traumatized and clinging together for warmth. Roughly seven hundred fifty million people left on the face of the Earth, if our estimates hold right, if the decimation's been uniform. Sounds like a lot, don't it. Just us seven hundred fifty million left, among six billion-odd corpses. In the end, it gives you something to shoot for, doesn't it? You bury nine corpses, and then you've done your part.

In the beginning, the worst we faced - beyond the fires, beyond the rats running free, beyond the stink of rotting flesh, beyond the - the worst we faced of humanity, is what I mean, was a couple of kids with their daddy's rifles, thinking they were raiders. We disarmed them peacefully, they're living with us now. But now, now that we're just starting to get organized again, and people have to go and get trouble.

"There," Merle whispers, nudging his elbow into my side, pointing to the bloody handprints chalked across the wall. Too neat, to clean to have been placed there accidentally. Alistair and his goddamn cultists. I grip my rifle tighter, the hairs on my neck going up. "Marking their territory," Merle says. "Trying to expand."

And we're crouching low, but there's a whistle that sounds above the rooftops, and our eyes turn to the sky. "Run!" I yell, and there are footsteps sounding, chanting, figures stirring in the abandoned buildings. "Get back to base!" And a bullet whistles through the air and takes Merle through the shoulder and he gasps and stumbles and I'm grabbing his shirt, dragging him along, the two of us running together.

Here's the thing about surviving: it makes you think you're special. It makes you think you're chosen. It makes you think that maybe everything else you do to survive is justified. It wasn't a God that spared us, no, no. Christian, Muslim, Jew, Buddhist, struck down like anyone else. It wasn't skin color or race. It wasn't where we lived, it wasn't how rich we used to be before the fall. It wasn't anything we ate or drank, wasn't anything we watched or heard or knew. In our group, it was Sarah, Stevie's little girl, who was the first of us to figure it out, to voice it, I think under a week after it all happened. But all of us must've been thinking it in some form or another as we made our way through the trauma, it must've been percolating through my head as I shook hands with another stranger, as we passed each other supplies, as I watched them work. Such a stupid, pointless little trait. And since it didn't match up with any doctrine or dogma, they've made up a religion to fit it. A religion that says that we are Chosen. That we are the inheritors of the Earth.

"You have a chance!" booms Alistair's voice from outside, as me and Merle huddle behind a bank counter, my rifle at the ready, Merle sweating and pale and his breathing going hard. His cultists are parting like the sea, and I peek up and I see Alistair, all in in black, black hair, black beard, the bloody handprint crusted across his chest. "Join us! We recognize not the laws of the old world, a world that sought to persecute and marginalize us! You seek to reestablish your own oppressors! That ugly thing you call Civilization! Join us, brothers, and recognize the New World Order!" He's arrogant, that bastard, an utter fanatic, arms spread, smile wide. Merle's eyes are flickering closed, the blood spreading across his shirt. I steady my rifle. I think I may be able to get off one shot.

"Join us!" screams Alistair, his face a perfect spot of white in my sights as his followers begin to flood in, their own weapons raised. "Join us on the Left-Hand Path!"
